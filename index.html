          <h1>Villa Capra "La Rotonda"</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Villa La Rotonda is a Renaissance villa just outside Vicenza, northern Italy, designed by Andrea Palladio.
The proper name is Villa Almerico Capra, but it is also known as La Rotonda, Villa Rotonda, Villa Capra
and Villa Almerico. The name "Capra" derives from the Capra brothers, who completed the building after it
was ceded to them in 1591. Like other works by Palladio in Vicenza and the surrounding area, the building is
conserved as part of the World Heritage Site "City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto".
Building began in 1567. Palladio, and the owner, Paolo
Almerico, were not to see the completion of the villa. Palladio
died in 1580 and a second architect, Vincenzo Scamozzi, was
employed by the new owners to oversee the completion. One of
the major changes he made to the original plan was to modify the two-storey centre hall.

<h2>1 Facade</h2>

<p>The ville is composed by four identical facades, so here is exposed the
building of one of them. At the end, the facade is replicated on all four
sides by the functions T and R.</p>

<h3>1.1 Steps</h3>

<p>The steps were made with the STRUCT function applied on a CUBOID and a translation (T) on the
coordinates y and z. SIMPLEX_GRID was used for the small walls on steps sides and a couple of
replicated CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE (one horizontal and one vertical) for the grate of the small windows</p>

<h3>1.2 Tunnel</h3> 
<p>In the building of the tunnel behind the steps was used the function SIMPLEX_GRID for the simple polygons (the simple walls). The archway is made by two bidimensional NUBS for the archs and a product between them by the BEZIER (S1) function.</p>
<h3>1.3 Colonnade</h3>
<p>This part of the ville is composed by the columns and the two archways on the sides; them are both composed by different parts, so they're going to be analyzed singly.</p>
<h4>1.3.1 Columns</h4>
<p>The columns consist in a unique column, of whose composition is explained below, translated on x- coordinate.</p>
<h5>1.3.1.1 Base and body</h5>
<p>The column's base was made using a CUBOID and a surface above it generated by a ROTATIONAL_SURFACE used on a bidimensional NUBS. The body is a ROTATIONAL_SURFACE on a
NUBS too: the profile was made using the "6/5 at 1/3" rule, that says that the column's radius, at 1/3 of the height, is 6/5 of the base's radius.</p>

<h5>1.3.1.2 Capital</h5>
<p>It may appear not perfectly roundish, cause all domains have to be mantained low, in order not to load the entire project too much.
The capital,in ionic style, was made by a couple of bidimensional NUBS for the profile, and a series of BEZIER between them to generate the volute's lateral surfaces and relief. It was also used a TORUS_SURFACE to made the echinus between the volutes.</p>

<h4>1.3.2 Lateral archways</h4>
<p>The archway's base was made using SIMPLEX_GRID. The arch's pillars were made by SIMPLEX_GRID too. The arch is modeled by two bidimensional NUBS and a BEZIER between them to generate the surface, the same tecnique used for the tunnel.
There's a particular ornament in the middle of the arch: it has a particular shape, modeled using a SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEX with 8 vertices and 6 faces. All parts of the structure are put together in a STRUCT, after replicated on the other side of the colonnade.</p>

<h3>1.4 Gable</h3>
<p>This is probably the most difficult part to model, because it has a lot of details, such as the cornice or the drops. The other ornaments on the gable's background will be analyzed at the last paragraph ("Other Ornaments"), cause they were added at the end of the project along with statues.
<br/>For the cornices were used a series of bidimensional NUBS to make the profiles and then a BEZIER function on them to generate the surfaces, four in all, three for the triangle's boundary and one for the cornice under it. One point of each the NUBS that generate the triangle's boundary surface, were also used to make the gable's background: they were the vertixes of a triangle generated with a SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEX (three vertixes, one faces). The roof was also made using the points of the NUBS curves: it is a BEZIER on two NUBS, one generated using the point at the start of the cornice and the point at the end, the other one generated by a translation on z-coordinates of the first. 
<br/>The drops were using the same tecnique used for the steps: a small cuboid a T (translation) function put into a STRUCT n times (with REPLICA function); the translation for the drops at the bottom is only on the x-coordinate, instead for those in diagonally the translation in on x,y coordinates. For the drops at the sides was used finally a translation on z-coordinate.
</p>
Every part described is put into a STRUCT after a series of rototranslation and scaling, in order to form the model <i>Facade</i>.
