<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Villa La Rotonda is a Renaissance villa just outside Vicenza, northern Italy, designed by Andrea Palladio.
The proper name is Villa Almerico Capra, but it is also known as La Rotonda, Villa Rotonda, Villa Capra
and Villa Almerico. The name "Capra" derives from the Capra brothers, who completed the building after it
was ceded to them in 1591. Like other works by Palladio in Vicenza and the surrounding area, the building is
conserved as part of the World Heritage Site "City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto".
Building began in 1567. Palladio, and the owner, Paolo
Almerico, were not to see the completion of the villa. Palladio
died in 1580 and a second architect, Vincenzo Scamozzi, was
employed by the new owners to oversee the completion. One of
the major changes he made
to the original plan was to
modify the two-storey
centre hall.

<h2>1 Facade</h2>

<p>The ville is composed by four identical facades, so here is exposed the
building of one of them. At the end, the facade is replicated on all four
sides by the functions T and R.</p>

<h3>1.1 Steps</h3>

<p>The steps were made with the STRUCT function applied on a CUBOID and a translation (T) on the
coordinates y and z. SIMPLEX_GRID was used for the small walls on steps sides and a couple of
replicated CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE (one horizontal and one vertical) for the grate of the small windows</p>
