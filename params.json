The name \"Capra\" derives from the Capra brothers, who completed the building after it\r\nwas ceded to them in 1591. Like other works by Palladio in Vicenza and the surrounding area, the building is\r\nconserved as part of the World Heritage Site \"City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\".\r\nBuilding began in 1567. Palladio, and the owner, Paolo\r\nAlmerico, were not to see the completion of the villa. Palladio\r\ndied in 1580 and a second architect, Vincenzo Scamozzi, was\r\nemployed by the new owners to oversee the completion. One of\r\nthe major changes he made\r\nto the original plan was to\r\nmodify the two-storey\r\ncentre hall.\r\n![Front](https://github.com/dario1089/mairepo1/raw/gh-pages/images/view.jpg)![Front](https://github.com/dario1089/mairepo1/raw/gh-pages/images/plant.jpg)\r\n## 1 Facade\r\nThe ville is composed by four identical facades, so here is exposed the\r\nbuilding of one of them. At the end, the facade is replicated on all four\r\nsides by the functions T and R.\r\n### 1.1 Steps\r\nThe steps were made with the STRUCT function applied on a CUBOID and a translation (T) on the\r\ncoordinates y and z. SIMPLEX_GRID was used for the small walls on steps sides and a couple of\r\nreplicated CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE (one horizontal and one vertical) for the grate of the small windows","name":"Villa Capra (La Rotonda)","tagline":""}
